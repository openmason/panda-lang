#### Definition

    mycolors = {black, white, green, yellow};
    set1 = {} // empty set
    { 2, 3, 4} == { 2, 3, 3, 4} == { 4, 3, 2} 

#### Operations
  * in (membership)
    * x in A (check if x is a member of set A)
  * Subset (<) - A is a subset of B, if everything in A is also in B
    * set1 = {2,3,4}, set2={2}
    * set2 <= set1 (true)
    * set2 !< set1 (not subset)
  * Proper subset
    * set2 < set1 (true)
  * 

## List
  * tally
  * length
